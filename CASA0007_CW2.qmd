## Introduction
Life expectancy (LE) is a commonly used metric to assess the mortality rate in a population, it takes into account the overall mortality rate of a population. LE is often used as a summary measure of a population's overall health and well-being, as it provides a clear and easy-to-understand indicator of mortality, which allows for meaningful comparisons of mortality rates across populations, as it adjusts for variations in the proportion of older or younger individuals in each population [@Modig].
